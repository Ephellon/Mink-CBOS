Step-by-step instructions:

I. Create a sub-directory in APP, and inside of it, a group of files: app.html, app.js, app.css [and if needed, a sub-directory 'mof' to hold extra 'pages' and/or data, i.e. form data, form submission pages, cache pages, etc.]

II. Name the directory com.|company|.|name| (like Android apps)

III. Build your app as app.html

IV. Link your app to the Mink OS:
	i. In the index.html file, add the following:

<a href="APP/com.company.name/app.tml" app>
Name*
</a>
<br /><br />

-Or, proceed to § ii

	ii. While running the Mink OS, select ' Settings | Apps | Add ' and enter the company and name of the app
*Note: If you clear browser cookies ALL app data, locations, and references will be deleted if you choose not to do § i

*Note: ¹ is to be updated (either fixing, or creating)

*Note: be sure to include the following in your app.html file if you need the resources: BASIC-STARTUP.txt
